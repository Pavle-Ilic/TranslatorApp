# TranslatorApp
Built an English to French translator using the hugging face t5-base LLM. Attempted to build it with an encoder/decoder biderectional RNN but it did not go as planned :( The transformer that is being used for the web application is the t5-small. To see more accurate translations run the t5-base code locally on your computer instead.
